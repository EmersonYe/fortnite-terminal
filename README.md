# Fortnite-terminal
Bash script to bring the default dance and tune to a terminal near you.

## Press B to dance
If you're in-game. Otherwise type this into your terminal:

`curl -Ls tinyurl.com/fndance | bash`

Which is equivalent to:

`curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmersonYe/fortnite-terminal/master/dance | bash`

## Shoutout
Huge shout out to [@keroserene](https://github.com/keroserene) and [@hugomd](https://github.com/hugomd) for [rickrollrc](https://github.com/keroserene/rickrollrc) and [parrot.live](parrot.live), respectively. I learned a lot by reading their code and enjoy their clean code and senses of humor.
